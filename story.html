     <h2>The Story</h2>
      <div>
        <p>Pretty Woman is an American comedy romantic story released in March 23, 1990. The film was at number one at the US box office, classic romantic, royalty, wealth,  timeless love films that have flourished after their premiere on television and in theatres . The film's title Pretty Woman is based on the 1964 song "Oh, Pretty Woman" by Roy Orbison. The original screenplay was titled “3,000,” and was written by then-struggling screenwriter J. F. Lawton. The film's story centres on Hollywood escort - Vivian Ward and wealthy businessman Edward Lewis. Vivian is hired to be Edward's escort for several business and social functions, and their relationship develops during her week-long stay with him for $3,000.</p> 

         <p>Edward Lewis with his extreme wealth and good looks, could seemingly have any woman he wanted. He needs a committed partner to keep him under wraps at social gatherings so he can continue his corporate looting business. However, because he spends more time with his partner and lawyer, Philip Stuckey, than he does with women, every significant relationship he has had ended.
         Taking his lawyer's Lotus Esprit sports vehicle, Edward ends up in the city's red-light district on Hollywood Boulevard one night after attending a business party in the Hollywood Hills. It is here that he meets prostitute Vivian Ward. Lost and struggling to operate the manual transmission car, Edward pays Vivian to show him the way to the Regent Beverly Wilshire Hotel. Impulsively, Edward hires Vivian for the night and, despite initial awkwardness, finds her charming and ultimately has sex with her.</p>

         <p>The following day, Edward asks Vivian to accompany him during a week-long series of business events he must attend while attempting to acquire James Morse's shipbuilding company. After some negotiation, Edward offers Vivian $3,000 which she excitedly accepts. He gives her money to buy appropriate clothes.
         Edward is shocked by Vivian's new appearance afterward and realizes he is running late. He takes notice of Vivian's transformation and becomes more open with her. He reveals details about his personal and business life, including his estranged relationship with his late father, Carter, at the time of his death.
         Edward is beginning to have second thoughts about his deal with Morse. The next day, Edward takes Vivian to a polo match sponsored by his company. He introduces her to Phil and his wife, Elizabeth. Vivian talks to David Morse, who is playing in the polo match. Paranoid, Phil interrogates Edward about Vivian and her job, as he suspects she’s a spy for the Morses. Edward tells him she’s a hooker, and Phil laughs malevolently. He goes and taunts Vivian about it, asking for her services after Edward leaves. When they return home, Vivian is mad that Edward told Phil about her profession. She storms out, and when Edward tries to give her money, she refuses it. As she’s waiting for the elevator, Edward comes out and apologizes, and she returns with him. After intercourse, Vivian tells Edward about how her awful dating history landed her in Hollywood. She couldn’t make the rent, and after meeting Kit she became a prostitute. The next day, Edward leaves work early to go on a date with Vivian. She wears a stunning red dress and an expensive necklace that Edward got on loan, and he takes her to the opera La Traviata, in San Francisco via private jet. Vivian loves the opera, and cries at the last song. Over chess, Vivian persuades Edward not to work the next day.</p>

         <p>On Edward's day off, the couple falls more deeply in love. They go to the park and have a picnic, Edward reads Shakespeare aloud to Vivian, they have in depth conversations over dinner, and they feel like a real couple.
         Edward asks to see her again, and tells her he has organized an apartment and car for her in New York to get her off the streets. While it is an appealing offer, it does not strike Vivian as particularly romantic, and she tells him that she wants a knight on a white horse to save her, not a sugar daddy. Edward receives a call from Phil, and goes to meet Morse. He tells Vivian that he cannot offer her the romance she wants right now, and she feels even more like a prostitute.
         Kit arrives at the hotel, and the friends are reunited. As they talk, Kit can see that Vivian is in love with Edward and tries to convince her that it could work out
         Edward requests a meeting with Morse alone, and offers to buy his whole company and help it, instead of buying it and taking it apart for a greater profit. Morse tells Edward that he is proud of him, but Edward's decision infuriates Phil. Edward leaves the office to go for a walk, and Phil goes to the hotel to find Vivian. Phil hits Vivian and tries to sexually assault her as he blames her for Edward’s change of heart. Edward comes in just in time, punches Phil, and throws him out. As Edward ices Vivian’s face, she praises him on his decision with Morse. Vivian tells Edward she wants to leave, explaining that she wants the fairy tale, and Edward tells her it is impossible. He gives her money, and she begins to leave. Edward asks her to stay the night without pay, but she refuses. She leaves.</p>

         <p>Vivian prepares to leave for San Francisco, where she will complete her high school education. She bids Kit farewell with an embrace and money, assuring her she has potential. After requesting that Barnard return the necklace, Edward departs from the hotel. It is implied that Darryl knows where Vivian lives because Barnard tells him that Daryll the driver transported her home the day before.</p>

         <p>As Vivian prepares to leave for San Francisco, she hears a car horn out her window. When she looks, Edward is standing out of the sunroof of his car, holding flowers; as opera plays, he proclaims his love for "Princess Vivian." Despite being scared of heights, he climbs the fire escape to get to her. They kiss, and live happily ever after.</p>

      <h2>My View</h2>
      <div>
         <p>Pretty Woman is really a wonderful, loving and amusing film. To be honest, it's both charming and entertaining. I adore each actor's unique creative performance. Pretty Woman is a sweet romantic comedy, an innocent love story in the middle of self-interest and agreement. It remains as an entertaining motion picture that had women calling out the delights of true love. What interests me most is that, the conversation started with request for money being Vivian an harlot, ended up into a relationship money can't buy. Edward( a millionaire)found Vivian (an hooker) fascinating from the first time of talking to her . He asked Vivian direction to his hotel after he got lost in Hollywood Boulevard, she demanded for 20 pounds for directions not for sex in which he eventually agreed to pay. Vivian seems to know a lot  about cars, which she told Edward after she saw that Edward was not good in driving. This intrigued him and later allowed her to drive the car. Edward who was disappointed by his girlfriend, seems to have enjoyed little time spent with Vivian, and invited her to join the hotel. Vivian being a prostitute, didn’t crushed her good spirit, beauty and character which led Edward to fall in love with her.  Money isn’t everything: it may have been a billion dollar deal, but you can’t put a price on true love, Vivian rejects his offer initially, she claims it is because she wants love and an emotional connection as well.</p> 

         <p>In addition to the creative performance, a great deal of work went into this film. An incredible budget of substantial, $14 million was allocated, and I have to say that the film is well worth the money spent. Not only that, It returned to number one at the US box office in its sixth weekend and was number one for three weeks. It was in the Top 10 movies in the US for 16 weeks. In Australia, it was number one for 12 weeks and was number one for nine consecutive weeks in the UK . 
         Even though I'm not a movie expert, I think that Pretty Woman has some amazing visuals, music, eye-catching graphics, and  vibrant color schemes. The color scheme was seasoned with a shooting blend of white, black and red. White is a symbol of rebirth that represent Vivian characters. The color reinforces the message of cleanliness, innocence and simplicity. Black reappears as the saddest and most dramatic scenes. Julia Roberts is decidedly warm and, therefore, little in harmony with the black while RED the symbol of love, and it has been used to show love and devotion between Edward and Vivian. Brown is not missing out in the amazing warm color. Apart from the movie been entertaining and amusing, it brings a lot of romance on the scene with special performances of Edward and Vivian. I was really moved by the blend of humour, romance also brought hope to Vivian. All the characters of the film are convincing, original and sympathetic, feeling comfortable with each other. Overall, I really liked this film, it made me feel good, to be watched over and over again.  The movie has many memorable lines and if you fall in love with the movie you will go back to it again and again. Great movie!</p>

            <p>Pretty Woman is a very entertaining film indeed. However, for me, it isn't completely perfect, there were times when the script could have been developed a LITTLE more, and the film itself is a bit on the long side. But overall, you have a charming and entertaining movie. Richard Gere is a charming lead, and I do find him charming in everything he's in. Julia Roberts is wonderful also as Vivienne Ward, a beautiful but down on her luck sort of woman. </p>

            <p>The combination of appealing leads, killer chemistry, and a banging soundtrack makes Pretty Woman a highly enjoyable film. The story is obviously a bit far-fetched, but who cares? It's a movie. I watch movies to be entertained and to enjoy well-told stories, and Pretty Woman certainly works on both fronts. The script, while a little frothy and contrived at times, still had a lot of humour and heart. Overall, I really liked this film, it made me feel good.</p>

            <p>What is it about this movie that made it such an instant mega smash when it was released? I'm not sure if it's The incredible chemistry between Gear and Roberts, the smart dialog, the storyline-combination of all of the above-etc etc. But I do think These days, so few GREAT romantic comedies get made. Pretty woman is great. I enjoyed every moment of this and have seen it many times. The story and acting in Pretty woman, while very obviously being.</p>
